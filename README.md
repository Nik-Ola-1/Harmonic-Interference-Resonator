# Harmonic Interference Resonator (HIR)

The Harmonic Interference Resonator (HIR) is an open-source consciousness technology prototype designed to interface with the quantum vacuum through real-time biofeedback, field modulation, and visualized coherence states.

## Modules

- EEG & Bio-Signal Capture (OpenBCI, HRV, GSR)
- Real-Time Coherence Detection
- EM Field Modulation (Arduino)
- Unity Visualizer Interface
- Session Logging & Anomaly Detection

## Theoretical Basis

Rooted in the Lucid Interference Model (LIM), this project explores whether consciousness can organize or influence field-level physics through harmonic entrainment.

## Disclaimer

This is a highly experimental project at the intersection of neuroscience, quantum theory, and metaphysics. No claims are made beyond exploratory research.
