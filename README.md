# Harmonic Interference Resonator (HIR)

**"Tune Consciousness. Shape Reality."**

The Harmonic Interference Resonator (HIR) is an experimental, open-source consciousness-technology platform that explores the interface between human bio-signals and the quantum vacuum. Inspired by fringe physics, EEG biofeedback, and real-time field modulation, HIR is a modular system designed to detect, visualize, and modulate coherent intent.
